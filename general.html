        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). 
        Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. 
        The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. 
        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by 
        European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, 
        including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <div class="general"></div>
        <p>Malus sieversii is recognized as a major progenitor species to the cultivated apple, 
        and is morphologically similar. Due to the genetic variability in Central Asia, this region is 
        generally considered the center of origin for apples.The apple is thought to have been domesticated 
        4000 - 10000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, 
        with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), 
        and Europe (M. sylvestris). Only the M. sieversii trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains 
        contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.</p>
        <h2>Production</h2>
        <div class="general"></div>
        <p>World production of apples in 2020 was 86 million tonnes, with China producing 47% of the total (table). 
        Secondary producers were the United States and Turkey.</p>
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <div class="general"></div>
        <p>A raw apple is 86% water and 14% carbohydrates, with negligible content of fat and protein (table). 
        A reference serving of a raw apple with skin weighing 100 grams provides 52 calories and a moderate 
        content of dietary fiber. Otherwise, there is low content of micronutrients, 
        with the Daily Values of all falling below 10%.</p>
